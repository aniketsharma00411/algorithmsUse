Common Algorithms which are usually taught in Data Structures and Algorithms courses.

### Hacktoberfest

This repo is Hactoberfest friendly. As long as the program is properly commented, variable names are intuited, program works, is not already present, and added to this README list it to it will be accepted.

### Contributions

Add any Algorithm which is not already present in its respective Programming Language directory.

If you don't find your favorite programming language's directory, feel free to create it.

Updates to this README are also appreciated.

You can also contact me if you have any issues.
