This repo is Hactoberfest friendly. As long as the program is properly commented, variable names are intuited, it works and is not already present, it will be accepted.

### Contributions

Add any Algorithm which is not already present in its respective Programming Language directory.

If you don't find your favorite programming language's directory, feel free to create it.

Updates to this README are also appreciated.

You can also contact me if you have any issues.
