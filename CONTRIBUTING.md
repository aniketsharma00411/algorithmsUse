Welcome to [algorithmsUse](https://github.com/aniketsharma00411/algorithmsUse)! Before sending your pull requests, make sure you read the complete guideleines. If you still have any doubts, feel free to create an issue or [contact us](https://github.com/aniketsharma00411).

## Contributing

**Add any Algorithm** which is not already present in its respective Programming Language directory. If you don't find your favorite programming language's directory, feel free to create it.

**Update** the **main README** and the **respective language's README** with your program's name. These README are used for reference to check which algorithms are present.

**Improving README and/or comments** are also appreciated.

**Proper Tests** for already present algorithms are also highly welcome.

## Coding Style

- Make sure you follow the **standard coding style** of the language you are using.

- Stricly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name.
